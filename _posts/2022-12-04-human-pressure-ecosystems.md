Caroline is a PostDoc studying the effects of human pressure across scales and ecosystems with a particular focus on plant and marine systems. We discuss the impact of human land use on plants and trees in Europe, the revolution of plant, climate and human footprint data available for ecological analysis, the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems, the decline of coral reefs and the potential for massive conservation and regeneration of endangered species and environments from analysing global data and taking these insights on board.
