Clodagh is a certified psychedelic therapist, mother of mushrooms and a psychonaut. We discuss psychedelic therapy, the medicalisation of psychedelics, the spirit of the mushroom and its ancient healing potential, the taboo surrounding psilocybin and plant medicines, the divine femininity, the evolution of humanity through psychedelics, DMT, Ayahuasca, 5-Meo-DMT and so much more!
