Tanya is a virology PhD student studying transduction in bacteria and their phages. Had an absolute blast chatting to Tanya and was positively giddy as she talked me through the many diverse modes of phage transduction. We talk about horizontal gene transfer, generalized, specialized and lateral transduction as well as the more fringe molecular piracy of phage satellites and Gene Transfer Agents. These diverse mechanisms serve to increase the genetic mobility and fitness of phages or their host bacterium in their ancient molecular arms race. My mind was blown on more than 1 occasion. Thanks again Tanya!
