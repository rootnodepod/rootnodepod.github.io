Robert is a horticulturist and soil enthusiast. We discuss the current state of the soil's health, the Dust bowl as a case study, the effects of industrial agriculture and the Green Revolution, the struggle of being a modern day farmer, the bottleneck in food production, and regenerative agriculture techniques which can restore soil health.
